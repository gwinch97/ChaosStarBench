# ChaosStarBench

Open-source benchmark suite for testing faults in cloud microservices, adapted from the original DeathStarBench[github.com/delimitrou/DeathStarBench] developed by the SAIL group.

ChaosStarBench currently only includes fault injection functionality for the Social Network deployment, however, fault injection will hope to be expanded to the remaining microservice deployments in the future.
